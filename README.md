# Parking Space Detection Using Computer Vision and Deep Learning (Comparison Between Object Detection and Object Classification Methods)

This project aims to enhance parking space detection through computer vision, deep learning, and a novel boundary comparison method. Multiple state-of-the-art algorithms are evaluated for accuracy and efficiency, including detection models (RetinaNet, SSD, YOLO8, YOLO9) and classification models (ResNet50, VGG16, AlexNet, MobileNet).

## Features

- **Boundary Configuration**  
  Use `Config_Generator.py` to load a video, extract the first frame, and manually draw parking boundaries using four points. Multiple boundaries can be added, and the configuration can be saved for later use.

- **Detection & Classification Testing**  
  Run `Parking_Occupation_Detector_Using_Classification.py` and `Parking_Occupation_Detector_Using_Detection.py` to test different models.  
  - Load the saved configuration and video.  
  - Select the desired model via Python GUI.  
  - View real-time detection results and save processed images.  
  - Frames are skipped during processing to optimize speed for testing.

## Usage

### Step 1: Configuring Parking Boundaries
1. Run `Config_Generator.py`.  
2. Load a video and draw parking boundaries on the first frame using four points.  
3. Save the configuration file for future detection tasks.

### Step 2: Testing Detection & Classification
1. Run either `Parking_Occupation_Detector_Using_Classification.py` or `Parking_Occupation_Detector_Using_Detection.py`.  
2. Load the saved configuration and select a model through the GUI.  
3. Observe real-time detection results and processed images.  
4. Frames are processed with frame skipping for faster testing.

## Note
- The system is designed for flexibility and speed, allowing rapid testing of multiple models on custom parking lot configurations.
